A dramatic aerial bombardment Orbital Beam Laser. Hold the left mouse button to fire the laser.

The effect comes complete with texture animation, sparks, smoke, flickering light, scorch mark and sound effects, with a custom script to provide complete control.

Load the "Orbital_Laser_Beam.unity" for an example scene, or drag the Orbital_Beam_Laser.prefab asset from the Prefabs folder from the Project window into the Hierarchy window (make sure the asset it raised up slightly on the Y axis so the scorch mark isn't beneath the ground).

Have fun!
