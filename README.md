# DestroyAllEarthlings
Destroy everyone, destroy everything!

This is a small game I'm making for fun in my free time using the Unity3d game engine.

Please note that the assets on the 3rd Party folder are not free, and if you want to use them on your project you must buy them from [the asset store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/)

This is a work in progress... and hopefully i'll finish it eventually :)
